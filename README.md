# Temperature_Converter
A simple program to convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. There are two programs; the "non simplified" one uses a bunch of value methods for the calculations. The "simplified" one integrates those calculations into the larger methods. I don't know which one is better and need Leone to tell me.
