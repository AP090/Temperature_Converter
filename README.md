# Temperature Converter

A simple program to convert between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin.

There are two programs:
  - "non simplified"
    - uses a bunch of value methods for the calculations.
  - "simplified"
    - integrates those calculations into the larger methods.

I don't know which one is better and need Leone to tell me.
